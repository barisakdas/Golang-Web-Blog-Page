# Golang-Web-Blog-Page
Using the Go language, I prepared a blog page project with a minimum level of special library dependency in the simplest way. For now, it contains only basic information and operations. However, the codes inside will help you easily add more details. You can easily deploy and live the project on Docker or Kubernetes.

## Database
I preferred postgresql as the database on the basis of the project, but you can use any database that gorm.io supports or by using other libraries.
